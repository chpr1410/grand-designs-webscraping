# Project Summary
In this simple project, I perform web scraping with Selenium Webdriver to get the information and URL for each episode of the popular British home building show "Grand Designs".

# Project Process
This application first navigates to the show's homepage in an automated web browser.  Then, it manuevers around cookies and other settings' roadblock messages.  The application scrolls through the webpage, clicking the 'Load More' button until all of the 200 episodes are displayed.  The script then programatically obtains episode title, description, air date, and url for each episode.  Finally, this information is saved in an Excel spreadsheet which can be used to quickly navigate to each episode and check them off as watched.
